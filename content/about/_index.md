My name is Vincent Schwarzer and live in Berlin. 

I am a Software Engineer currently working as DevOps Consultant. My focus is consulting companies about Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines and best practices building micro services / APIs running on cloud providers (IaaS) or on premise hardware. I also design, develop, automate, review and troubleshoot distributed systems and applications.
